Unofficial Competition Guide
============================

The purpose of this guide is to help students in programming competitions. It
is composed by several implementations, **most** of them was tested. The ones
that weren't tested have a **NOT TESTED** label at the top of the page. And the ones
that were there will be a label indicading which questions that implementation
was tested.

Those implementations might not be the best. So, feel free to contribute
with improvements and new algortihms. And if you find any bug, report on the
issue tracker.

This guide structure is based on the `Competitive Programming Book <http://cpbook.net/>`_.
For each chapter there is a section with the implementations. There is an addtional
Utils section for codes that are not directly covered on the book, but are also
useful.

Most of the guide is implemented in C++, but there are some implementations
in: C, Java and Python.
