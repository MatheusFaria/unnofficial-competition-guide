Unofficial Competition Guide
============================

The porpouse of this guide is to help students in programming competitions. It 
is composed by several implementations, **most** of them was tested. The ones
that weren't tested have a **NOT TESTED** label at the page top. And the ones
that were there will be a label indicading which questions that implementation
was tested.

Those implementations can be not the best implementation, feel free to contribute
with improvement and new algortihms.

This guide structure is based on the `Competitive Programming Book <http://cpbook.net/>`_.
For each chapter there is a section with the implementations. There an addtional
Utils section for codes that are not directly covered on the book, but are useful.

Most of the guide is implemented on C++, but there are some implementations
in: C, Java and Python.
