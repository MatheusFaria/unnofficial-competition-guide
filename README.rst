Unofficial Competition Guide
============================

This project exists to register the algorithms that I know. It is dedicated to
programming competations like: Facebook hacker cup, Google code Jam, Code Forces, etc.
I made it so I can share my implementations and receive contributions from other
developers interested in this kind of algorithms.


How to contribute
=================

You can open a pull request with changes made to the code or to the documentation.
In case of:

* new algorithms: be sure to test your code.
* algorithm improvement: check if the old .
* documentation error (typos, new explations): you just need to open the pull request.


Be sure to follow all the patterns already in use on the current version, and always
contribute with a clean code with explations and comments.
